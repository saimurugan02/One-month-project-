Project topic - Image Forgery Detection Using Deep Learning With Image Processing 

1. Data Collecetion 
	Here for this project we are using images as a dataset 
	the images like Fake and real images of humans 

2. data pre processing 
	It is a process of reshaping all the images into same size of images. 

3. splitting of dataset 
	Train 
	test 

4. Model implementation 
	Deep Learning Model 
		MobileNet algorithm 

5. Training the model and saving the trained model in to a model file as h5 file 

6. Predicting test accuracy 

7. predicting classification report and confusion matrix 

8. Final prediction 
	Testing with single images and predicting the accuracy with Fake or Real Images
